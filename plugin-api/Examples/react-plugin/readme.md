# React example

This example shows how to create plugins with the React library.

## Setup

To run and develop

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

To actually use plugins with Metaflow UI, you'll need to build it. Running the following command creates a package in the `dist` folder. You still need to add manifest.json manually (There is an example manifest in the `dist.example` folder).

```sh
npm run build
```
