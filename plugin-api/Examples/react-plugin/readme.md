# React example

This example shows how to create plugin with React library.

## Setup

To run and develop

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

To actually use plugin with Metaflow UI, you'll need to build it. Running following command creates package to dist folder. You still need to add manifest.json manually (There is example manifest on dist.example folder).

```sh
npm run build
```
