# Tests

## Unit & Component tests

Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

```bash
$ yarn test
```

Run test on the command line only.

```bash
$ yarn test:ci
```

## UI Tests

Launch the e2e test runner UI (cypress) with a base URL given.

```bash
$ CYPRESS_BASE_URL=your_target_url yarn cypress:open
```

To run e2e tests headless

```bash
$ CYPRESS_BASE_URL=your_target_url yarn cypress:run
```

Some notes about UI tests

- Do not use classes generated by styled components in tests (they look like "sc-fzqPZZ") since these can change between builds. Better to use `data-testid` instead. If they are missing from components, feel free to add them.
- Unless you generate data yourself or use mock data, you should not depend on values in the UI to be exact. We don't want tests to break every time we jump to a new environment.
- Don't use exact URLs. Use `CYPRESS_BASE_URL` environment variable instead to give URLs to the front page.
- If your target is behind basic auth, you can add credentials to environment variables like `CYPRESS_BASE_URL=http://username:password@your_target_url`.
