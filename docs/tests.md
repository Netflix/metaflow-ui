```

To run e2e tests headless

```bash
$ CYPRESS_BASE_URL=your_target_url yarn cypress:run

Some notes about ui tests

- Do not use classes generated by styled components in tests (looks like "sc-fzqPZZ") since these can change between builds. Better to use data-testid instead. If they are missing from components, feel free to add them.
- Unless you generate data yourself or use mock data, you should not depend on values on UI to be exact. We don't want tests to break everytime we jump to new environment.
- Dont use exact URLs. Use CYPRESS_BASE_URL environment variable instead to give url to frontpage.
- If your target is behind basic auth, you can add credentials to environment variable like CYPRESS_BASE_URL=http://username:password@your_target_url.
