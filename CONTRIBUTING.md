# Workflow for development

We follow [Git Feature Branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
<br/>In short, do all of your development in a feature branch that will be merged into the master after a peer review.

We follow commit message conventions by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

### Suggested branch types:

- bug (bug fix)
- feat (new feature)
- hotfix (quick fixes to the codebase)
- docs (changes to documentation)
- refactor (refactoring production code)
- test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

### Examples for branch naming:

`feat/animating-timeline`
<br/>`feat/new-common-error-messages-component`
<br/>`docs/readme-update`

### Examples for commit messages:

`docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG`
<br/>`feat: enabled hidden feature flags`
<br/>`fix: removed small typos from translations`
